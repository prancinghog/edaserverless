Day 1
The monolith is being modified at an unsustainable rate, it is not the volume of pages but the plethora of features that cater to client requirements (and perhaps whims) that threaten to derail the application.
There is no testing framework integrated nor do the devs do a good job of thoroughly validating features before they are deployed in prod.
There is no proper code-review process and there is little accountability.

The business team faces the brunt of the bugs and this cannot go on further. Something needs to change.

Serverless may be the solution? I could have perhaps attempted containerizing the application but the volatility does not attract me. Every day we have new requirements or bugs.

https://www.serverless.com/ provides attractive options, may be it is time to give it a try.
